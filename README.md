# AskHome

A platform that uses Amazon Alexa to work with SmartThings.  
It is unique in that it is Person, Place, Thing (noun) centric, not device centric.
This SmartThings smartApp is for groovy programmers....all the logic is in the program
not in "fill in the blanks".  This gives tremendous freedom for those that know code
to generate complex and intuitive interactions.  

For those that do not enjoy coding, AskHome is not for you.   MichaelS has developed a 
device centric interface that works really well.  Fill in the blanks, and you can talk 
to devices by their capabilities.  Go get that App instead.

The installation requires an Amazon Developer Account.  You need to create an Alexa skill
and a Lambda Function.  I've included screen shots that will help you configure the Alexa Skill,
and I've provided the code to talk to smartthings for Lambda, you only need to fill in a smartthings 
App id and token to make it work.
